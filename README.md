This repository contains the **assignments** completed by a group of 3 students throughout the duration of the Embedded Systems course (DIT 633).

**Embedded Systems Course** is offered by the department of Computer Science and Engineering as a part of the **Software Engineering and Management** (SEM) Program.

Assignments are organized as work packages with the notation wp_X, where X represents the assignment number. Each work package contains an individual implementation of the assignment by each student, as well as a final version that results from joint efforts and peer code review.
